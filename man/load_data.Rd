\title{Load Returns or Factors Data}
\usage{
load_data(type = "p", do_checks = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{type}{A character string indicating the type of data to load. Valid options are "p" for portfolios, "i" for individual assets, and "f" for factors.}

\item{do_checks}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (the default), the function checks that \code{type} is one of "p", "i", or "f".}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix named \code{data} containing the data with the Date column removed. For \code{type = "p"}, each column corresponds to a portfolio's excess returns; for \code{type = "i"}, the matrix contains individual asset excess returns; for \code{type = "f"}, the matrix contains the Fama–French 5 factors (tradable).
}
\description{
This function loads and assembles data based on the specified type. The input
\code{type} can be one of the following:
}
\details{
"p" loads all double-sorted and industry portfolio objects from the SparsePortfolioSelection package.
The function removes the Date column from each portfolio object and aggregates their returns (columns represent portfolios)
into a single numeric matrix.

"i" loads the CRSP individual asset returns data from the SparsePortfolioSelection package.
It removes the Date column and returns a numeric matrix of individual asset returns.

"f" loads the Fama–French 5 factors (tradable version) data from the SparsePortfolioSelection package.
It removes the Date column and returns a numeric matrix of factors.

All data are assumed to have been filtered to include only observations with dates from May 2008 to December 2022.
