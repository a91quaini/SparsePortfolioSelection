\title{Compute one-way turnover over a full weight path}
\usage{
compute_turnover(weights, R_excess, rf, tol = 1e-12)
}
\arguments{
\item{weights}{List of weight vectors (one per rebalance) or a matrix with rows = rebalances.
Row t is the portfolio formed at the end of period t and held over period t+1.}

\item{R_excess}{Matrix of excess returns (rows are time, cols are assets).}

\item{rf}{Vector/scalar of risk-free rates aligned to rows of R_excess.}

\item{tol}{Tolerance for treating weights as zero.}
}
\value{
A list with \code{to} (vector of turnover per rebalance) and \code{median_to}.
}
\description{
Compute one-way turnover over a full weight path
